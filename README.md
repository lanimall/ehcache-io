# ehcache-io: Input/Output Streams for Ehcache

## Description
This extension creates a streaming capability (java.io) for Ehcache so clients can easily push/pull to/from ehcache with standard InputStream/OutputStream objects.
 * Stream objects/files into Ehcache (and/or into terracotta if your cache is distributed)
 * Stream objects/files from Ehcache (and/or from terracotta if your cache is distributed) back to your JVM for further processing, or further streaming to another Outputstream.

The general value of using such construct is to be able to process and store large objects little by little without having to load them all in your program's heap memory.
So this could be particularly useful for dealing with large data items (big xmls, binary files, images) that you'd want to store temporarily out of the heap while doing or waiting for something else...
and especially useful if your Ehcache caches leverage offheap memory and Terracotta for clustering.

Essentially, this implementation creates 2 new Ehcache-specific stream classes which are compliant with java.io InputStream and OutputStream contracts:
 * EhcacheOutputStream: writes to underlying Ehcache
 * EhcacheInputStream: reads from underlying Ehcache

The 2 main rationale for using these streaming classes are:
 * Plug-ability: You can plug these Ehcache stream into the extensive library of java.io streams (eg. File streams, socket streams, pipe streans, Checksum streams, Gzip streams, etcâ€¦)
 * JVM Memory control: When dealing with large files, you can overload local JVM memory very easily if you're loading them in heap (which standard Ehcache library would do). 
 But when you're using a "streaming" construct, only the bytes (or chunks of bytes) passing through are loaded in JVM Heap. 
 So for example, you could stream a 1GB file in Ehcache even if the client heap is 512MB.

## Building

```java
mvn clean package
```

If you want to run the EE Tests (eg. Offheap or Terracotta clustering), then use the ehcache-ee profile.

```java
mvn clean package -P ehcache-ee
```

## Usage / Features:

Both Input/Output Streams can be acquired from the factory "EhcacheStreamFactory" with 2 main static calls, 
always providing AT LEAST the underlying Ehcache "cache" and "cachekey".
Then, couple of optional behaviors can be used too. Here are simple details for each of the paramaters:

 * EhcacheStreamFactory.getInputStream
   * Cache cache (REQUIRED: the underlying cache that this stream will pull from)
   * Object cacheKey (REQUIRED: the underlying cache key that this stream will pull from)
   * int bufferSize (OPTIONAL: internal read buffer -- DEFAULT: 512kb)
   * boolean allowNullStream (OPTIONAL: Ability to specify if you want to get a NULL stream if the underlying cacheKey does not exist.
   If set to 'false', the stream will be functional and valid even if the key does not exist...it just won't return any byte!!
   DEFAULT: FALSE)
 
 * EhcacheStreamFactory.getOutputStream
   * Cache cache (REQUIRED: the underlying cache that this stream will pull from)
   * Object cacheKey (REQUIRED: the underlying cache key that this stream will pull from)
   * int bufferSize (OPTIONAL: Internal write buffer - This will be the block size in ehcache storage -- DEFAULT: 1MB)
   * boolean override (OPTIONAL: If true, any new data will override existing data for that same cacheKey. If false, data will be appended to that same cacheKey. DEFAULT: TRUE)

If you want to specify a global default buffer size throughput the application, I also added 2 system properties for that purpose:
 * ehcache.extension.io.inputstream.buffersize (global default size for the read buffer)
 * ehcache.extension.io.outputstream.buffersize (global default size for the write buffer)

## Code Samples:

1 - Copy local file into cache - FileInputStream to EhcacheOutputStream sample:
Note: I'm also using the CheckedInputStream here mostly to demonstrate plug-ability, but also for my own junit tests, making sure consistency before and after streaming.

```java
       ...
       try (
                CheckedInputStream is = new CheckedInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(Files.newInputStream(IN_FILE_PATH),inBufferSize),new CRC32());
                CheckedOutputStream os = new CheckedOutputStream(EhcacheStreamFactory.getOutputStream(cache, cache_key),new CRC32());
       )
       {
            Int in;
            byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferSize];
            while ((n = is.read(buffer)) > -1) {
                os.write(buffer, 0, n);
            }

            Assert.assertEquals(is.getChecksum().getValue(), os.getChecksum().getValue());
       }
       ...
```

2 - Copy a file in cache back to a local file - EhcacheInputStream to FileOutputStream
Note: I'm also using the CheckedInputStream here mostly to demonstrate plug-ability, but also for my own junit tests, making sure consistency before and after streaming.

```java
       try (
                CheckedInputStream is = new CheckedInputStream(EhcacheStreamFactory.getInputStream(cache, cache_key),new CRC32());
                CheckedOutputStream os = new CheckedOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(Files.newOutputStream(OUT_FILE_PATH)), new CRC32());
       )
       {
            int n;
            byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferSize];
            while ((n = is.read(buffer)) > -1) {
                os.write(buffer, 0, n);
            }

            Assert.assertEquals(is.getChecksum().getValue(), os.getChecksum().getValue());
       }
```
